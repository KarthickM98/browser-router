In this application we will be understanding how to add routing in the application :

**Routing** is a way of moving from one component to another component, it makes sure athat ur application is single single page application. In this case if we are a a browser router then our page will be never reloaded and still we will be able to move from one component to another.

**REACT ROUTER** is the master library to achieve the routing in react this contains two small libraries react-router-dom : this is for web application. 
 react-router-native : this is for mobile application.

When we are defining Routes or all the paths then u have to make sure that all of them are wrapped with the **Routes**.

The to define any route we use Route
